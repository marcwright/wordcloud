    lyrics: 'I stay out too late
            Got nothing in my brain
            Thats what people say, mmm-mmm
            Thats what people say, mmm-mmm

            I go on too many dates [chuckle]
            But I cant make them stay
            At least thats what people say, mmm-mmm
            Thats what people say, mmm-mmm

            But I keep cruising
            Cant stop, wont stop moving
            Its like I got this music
            In my mind
            Saying, Its gonna be alright.

            Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
            And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
            Baby, Im just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
            I shake it off, I shake it off
            Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
            And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
            Baby, Im just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
            I shake it off, I shake it off

            I never miss a beat
            Im lightning on my feet
            And thats what they dont see, mmm-mmm
            Thats what they dont see, mmm-mmm

            Im dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
            I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
            And thats what they dont know, mmm-mmm
            Thats what they dont know, mmm-mmm

            But I keep cruising
            Cant stop, wont stop grooving
            Its like I got this music
            In my mind
            Saying, Its gonna be alright.' },

            Oh oh
            Sipping on Ros√©, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy
            This is how we do
            Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy
            Playing ping pong all night long, everythings all neon and hazy
            This is how we do

            Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah
            All my girls vintage Chanel baby

            Its no big deal, its no big deal, its no big deal
            This is no big deal

            This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
            Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
            This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

            This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
            Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
            This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

            Big hoops, and maroon lips, my clique hoppin in my Maserati
            This is how we do
            Santa Barbara, chique, at La Super Rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
            Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all Japanese-y
            This is how we do
            Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

            Its no big deal, its no big deal, its no big deal
            This is no big deal

            This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
            Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
            This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

            This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
            Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
            This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

            This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last nights dress
            Its how we do, straight stuntin like that
            Uh-huh, I see you
