    lyrics: 'I stay out too late
            Got nothing in my brain
            Thats what people say, mmm-mmm
            Thats what people say, mmm-mmm

            I go on too many dates [chuckle]
            But I cant make them stay
            At least thats what people say, mmm-mmm
            Thats what people say, mmm-mmm

            But I keep cruising
            Cant stop, wont stop moving
            Its like I got this music
            In my mind
            Saying, Its gonna be alright.

            Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
            And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
            Baby, Im just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
            I shake it off, I shake it off
            Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
            And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
            Baby, Im just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
            I shake it off, I shake it off

            I never miss a beat
            Im lightning on my feet
            And thats what they dont see, mmm-mmm
            Thats what they dont see, mmm-mmm

            Im dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
            I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
            And thats what they dont know, mmm-mmm
            Thats what they dont know, mmm-mmm

            But I keep cruising
            Cant stop, wont stop grooving
            Its like I got this music
            In my mind
            Saying, Its gonna be alright.

              lyrics: 'This is how we do, This is how we do
Oh oh
Sipping on Ros√©, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy
This is how we do
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy
Playing ping pong all night long, everythings all neon and hazy
This is how we do

Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah
All my girls vintage Chanel baby

Its no big deal, its no big deal, its no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

Big hoops, and maroon lips, my clique hoppin in my Maserati
This is how we do
Santa Barbara, chique, at La Super Rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all Japanese-y
This is how we do
Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

Its no big deal, its no big deal, its no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last nights dress
Its how we do, straight stuntin like that
Uh-huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids that still have their cars at the club valet and its Tuesday
This is how we do yeah straight stuntin like that
Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money
Respect

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do
This goes out to all you people going to bed with a ten and waking up with a two
This is how we do straight stuntin like that
Ha, not me

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

What? Wait. No, no, no, no.
Bring the beat back.
Thats right

This is how we do, oh oh
This is how we do, oh oh

{ artist: 'The Beatles',
  title: 'I Am the Walrus',
  lyrics: "I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun see how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake waiting for the van to come
Corporation teeshirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you been a naughty boy. You let your face grow long
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob

Mister City Policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess
Boy you been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come
You get a tan from standing in the English rain
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob goo goo goo goo joob

Expert textpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you? (Ha ha ha! He he he! Ha ha ha!)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
I'm crying

Semolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man you should have seen them kicking Edgar Alan Poe
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob goo goo goo joob
Goo goo goo joob goo goo goo joob
Goo gooooooooooo jooba jooba jooba jooba jooba jooba
Jooba jooba
Jooba jooba
Jooba jooba" }
